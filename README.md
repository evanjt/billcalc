# billcalc
A simple program to calculate the amount someone owes for a bill at a shared house. It could also be used to split other things.

The program was initially written to overcome the hassle of calculating shared bills at a house when it wasn't an even split between tenants. This program will store household information, names of all tenants, and store bill information so that when a new bill is added, it calculates how much is owed by any tenant according to the time that they were at the house for.
